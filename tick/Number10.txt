Older partitions wouldn't have the new column.

Update sym.q schema file with new column, restart tickerplant and RDB to pick up changes.
For HDB, use addCol function of dbmaint.q script. 
Ensures new column name is valid (and not a reserved word), fills column with chosen default value and updates .d file across all partitions.
